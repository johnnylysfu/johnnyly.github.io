							<p><strong>K</strong>obe Bryant is an inspiration to many people around the world. 
								The five-time NBA champion had a lucrative career in the sport of basketball with many more achievements to show outside of the sport.  
								For some, he was an eyesore because of the way he completely dominated their favourite players with his Mamba Mentality. For others, he was their real-life superhero.  
								Regardless of where they were on this spectrum, people all around the world gathered to celebrate Kobe Bryant's legacy after the tragedy that ensued on the morning of January 26th in 2020.  
								On this day, Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gigi and seven others on board perished in a helicopter crash.  This sent ripples throughout the sports world, shaking millions of lives.

								<p><strong>I</strong>nstagram is one of the most popular social media platforms that have
									emerged since the start of the digital age. 
									There is no question about the change it has brought to society— from giving a voice to
									marginalized groups to quick dissemination of important news. However convenient and beneficial
									Instagram may be, it is not uncommon for its users to develop mental health issues from extensive usage of the app. 
									Some users who build unhealthy relationships with apps like Instagram are at
									risk for compromising their mental health and wellbeing. Many would say that because the app
									is photo based, it creates an environment for its users to easily compare themselves to others
									online. Instagram users are susceptible of falling for the trap of quantifying their intrinsic value to the
									level of interaction they get online in comparison to their peers. This can lead to problematic self
									esteem issues that set the stage for more complicated mental health issues further down the line. </p>

							<br>
							<p><strong>R</strong>acist remarks and xenophobia have been widely considered as one of the main
								reasons why the world cannot band together in difficult times. In 2020 it has never been more
								apparent with the start of the Coronavirus— the pandemic that
								shook the globe near the end of the first quarter in 2020. Although the pandemic began in late 2019 in
								Wuhan, the rest of the world would eventually experience its adverse effects months later as
								the virus quickly spread to other countries. This has resulted in fingers being pointed at the people of Wuhan and people of Asian descent for causing the global pandemic. 
								To further analyze how Coronavirus has insinuated racism towards Asian people, two opposing articles from mainstream media will be deconstructed and compared based on their discourse and target audience.</p>

							<p><strong>T</strong>he freedom of information comes with many risks in today’s network society.  
								Amongst them, fake news is an unsuspecting culprit that has strung society along for centuries and is now associated with disinformation, click-bait, false news, propaganda, 
								hoax news and many more.  Some viewers treat it as purely entertainment and believe it is harmless, but how do we distinguish fake from real news?  
								And where is the line drawn in terms of entertainment and the entire fabrication of a story?  Fake news is a term that has multiple implications and although it can be a source 
								of comedic relief, it can also ruin lives and be used to manipulate public opinion.  This exploratory paper will analyze the concept of fake news,
								 its purpose and impact on Canadians, and the growing importance of media literacy in an age of information overload.  
								 Academic and non-academic sources will be cited along with material from the course modules to tackle different points of views regarding fake news.  </p>
